# 99 problems in elm

I'm following this online document called [99 Problems, Solved in Elm].(https://johncrane.gitbooks.io/ninety-nine-elm-problems/content/p/p04.html) using Elm 0.18. It's pretty good. Now that the [SICP book](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/) is too hard for me (lmao), I'm changing my focus towards Elm.

## Update November 10, 2018

So im trying to change this to Elm 0.19 and it's hard lol. Here is a list of the questions with problems so far maybe an angel will descend from heaven and give me a pull request fixing all my problems

* [31.elm](src/31.elm) (might be right but seems sketchy)
* [23.elm](src/23.elm)
* [47.elm](src/47-DEPRECATED.elm) uses infix operators (operators that go between its arguments) but they aren't supported by elm anymore lol
